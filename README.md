# AHK-stuff

This repository is home to a collection of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) v2 mini-projects written and maintained by Expertcoderz, made open source to the public.

## Executables

Standalone exe files are provided per mini-project for convenience and are ready to be downloaded and run without the need for any external dependencies or AutoHotkey installed.

Each executable was compiled using Ahk2Exe (with [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) for compression). The icon applied are available alongside under the mini-project's folder.

Please be aware that since none of the executables are signed, they may be flagged as suspicious by antivirus software.

## Bugs & Improvements

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Expertcoderz/AHK-stuff/issues/new/choose) if you find any bugs or wish to make a suggestion of any sort.
