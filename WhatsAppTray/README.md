A program that places [WhatsApp Desktop](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/whatsapp/9NKSQGP7F2NH) onto the taskbar tray for convenient access.

**⚠️ Note:** Microsoft Store apps including WhatsApp Desktop are installed under the `%ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps` system directory. WhatsAppTray requires special permission to enumerate folders under `WindowsApps` to look for the executable file for WhatsApp Desktop (`WhatsApp.exe`), hence it must normally be run with administrator privileges to function.
