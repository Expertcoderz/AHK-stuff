**Released:** 2022-10-10 UTC | **Updated:** 2022-10-10 UTC

⚠️ 2022-10-15 UPDATE: THIS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY ON THE LATEST VERSION OF WHATSAPP DESKTOP.

---

A program that reduces [WhatsApp Desktop](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/whatsapp/9NKSQGP7F2NH) into a taskbar tray icon (as with Discord) which can be
double-clicked to restore WhatsApp, in contrast to the regular cluttery taskbar buttons.

WhatsAppTray runs in the background and only shows the tray icon when WhatsApp Desktop is running as well.
When selecting the *Quit WhatsApp* option in the tray menu, the user will be prompted on whether to close the WhatsAppTray program together with WhatsApp Desktop
(or just the latter).

WhatsApp Desktop is automatically minimized to the tray whenever another window is focused, unless the *Hide automatically* option in the tray menu is unchecked.
