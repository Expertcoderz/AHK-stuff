A quick and intuitive interface for easily [configuring Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-configure-using-wsb-file)
pre-launch, developed for the fact that Windows Sandbox currently lacks a built-in settings GUI of any sort and uses `wsb` files for defining settings in XML format.

WindowsSandboxLauncher provides all six basic security options supported by Windows Sandbox, and additionally allows for a RAM limit to be defined.
