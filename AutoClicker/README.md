From this point on, this AutoClicker program will only be updated to fix bugs where necessary, and is unlikely to receive any new features.

---

A pretty advanced auto-clicking utility, featuring:

* left/right/middle clicking
* single/double/triple clicking
* range-based randomized intervals (rest between clicks for a random duration within the specified range of milliseconds)
* option to automatically stop after a certain number of clicks, after a certain duration has elapsed, or both
* cursor auto-positioning options (user-controlled \[off] / fixed point / fixed box)

*Note:* In order for the clicks to be effective on UI belonging to elevated applications, AutoClicker must be run with administrative privileges.
